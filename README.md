- 👋 Hi, I’m @schedi
- 👀 I’m interested in coding with Java. I am a newbee, doing my studies in IT at a german university. I am very much interested to understand how all this works. And especially: How do people get access to other systems? Isn't it incredible...?!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all about Java and trying myself with those little codes like searching a directory.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all what you think I could help with. Shouldn't be only brewing coffee, but I help out... ;-)
- 📫 How to reach me you will find my contacts here!
